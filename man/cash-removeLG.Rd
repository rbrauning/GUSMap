\title{FS method: Remove Linkage Groups}
\usage{
FSobj$removeLG(LG, where = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{LG}{An integer vector specifying the number of the linkage groups to be removed.}

\item{where}{Character vector specifying which list of linkage groups to remove linkage groups from. \code{"LG"} is for 
the maternal and paternal linkage groups and \code{"LG_BI"} is for the combined linkage group list (see details).}
}
\description{
Method for removing linkage group(s) from the list of linkage groups contained
in an FS object.
}
\details{
In a linkage analysis in GUSMap, there may be need to remove linkage groups from the 
list of created linkage groups. The indices of the linkage groups corresponds to the number
given in the output for the FS object.

When \code{where = "LG-pts"}, linkage groups will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross 
linkage groups created via the \code{\link{$createLG}} function. On the other hand, if 
\code{where = "LG-comb"}, then linkage groups from the set of combined linkage groups 
created from the \code{\link{$addBIsnps}} function will be removed.
When \code{where = NULL}, linkage groups will be removed from the set of combined linkage groups if available,
otherwise they will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross linkage groups.
}
\examples{
## simulate sequencing data
config <- list(replicate(2,sample(c(1,2,4), size=30, replace=TRUE), simplify = FALSE))
F1data <- simFS(0.01, config=config, meanDepth=10, nInd=50)

## Compute 2-point recombination fractions
F1data$rf_2pt(nClust=1)
## create paternal and maternal linkage groups
F1data$createLG()

## remove linkage groups 2 and 4
F1data$removeLG(LG = c(2,4))
