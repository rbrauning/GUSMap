#' FS method: Write linkage groups/maps to file
#'
#' Method for writing results from a linkage analysis in GUSMap to a file.
#' 
#' The linkage groups written to file are the combined linkage groups produced by \code{\link{$addBIsnps}} and
#' ordered using \code{\link{$orderLG}}. If linkage maps are also computed using \code{\link{$computeMap}}, then 
#' information regarding the parameters estimates for the maps are also returned.
#' 
#' When \code{what = NULL}, the linkage mapping results computed using the \code{\link{$computeMap}} function are returned
#' if they are available, otherwise the combined linkage groups information is returned.
#' 
#' @usage
#' FSobj$writeLM(file, direct = "./", LG = NULL, what = NULL)
#' 
#' @name $writeLM
#' @param file Character value giving the name of the file to write to.
#' @param direct Character value for the directory to write the file to (relative to the current working working directory)
#' @param LG Integer vector giving the indices of the linkage groups to write. If \code{NULL}, the results for all the 
#' linkage groups are returned.
#' @param what Character vector specifying whether the combined linkage groups \code{"LG-comb"} are to be 
#' returned or the linkage mapping results \code{"map"}.
#' @return 
#' The function returns a csv file with the rows representing the SNPs and the columns containing the linkage group and linkage map 
#' information.
#' The columns of the file are:
#' \describe{
#' \item{LG}{The linkage number as given in the output from the FS object.}
#' \item{LG_POS}{The position of the SNPs across the linkage group. Starts at 1 and
#' increases by one for each SNP in the same linkage group.}
#' \item{CHROM}{The chromosome name the SNP was located on in the original genomic assembly.}
#' \item{POS}{The position (in base pairs) of the SNP on the original genomic assembly.}
#' \item{TYPE}{The segregation type of the SNP. Either BI (both-informative), 
#' MI (maternal-informative) or PI (paternal-informative).}
#' \item{RF_PAT}{The sum of the recombination fraction estimates for the paternal meioses. Starts at zero
#' for the first SNP in the linkage groups and increases across the linkage group.}
#' \item{RF_MAT}{The sum of the recombination fraction estimates for the maternal meioses. Starts at zero
#' for the first SNP in the linkage groups and increases across the linkage group.}
#' \item{ERR}{The sequencing error estimate for the SNP.}
#' \item{MEAN_DEPTH}{The mean read depth of the SNP.}
#' \item{CALLRATE}{The proportion of individuals in which there is at least one read across the SNP.}
#' }
#' If no linkage maps have been computed (using the \code{\link{$computeMap}}), then the
#' columns RF_PAT, RF_MAT and ERR are not returned.
